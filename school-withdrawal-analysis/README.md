# School Withdrawal Analysis (Tableau Project)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student withdrawal (dropout) rates using multiple school-related datasets.  
The goal is to understand **when**, **where**, and **why** students leave the education system, using interactive Tableau dashboards.

The project was completed as part of a data analytics internship task and focuses on data modeling, calculated fields, and dashboard storytelling in Tableau.


## Data Sources
The analysis is based on the following datasets:

- **Schools.csv** – School information and locations  
- **Students.csv** – Student demographics (gender, city, region, etc.)  
- **SchoolRegistration.csv** – Student registrations by school and year  
- **Withdrawals.csv** – Students who withdrew and their withdrawal year  
- **Graduates.csv** – Students who successfully graduated  
- **Rejected.csv** – Students whose registrations were rejected  

All tables are connected in Tableau using **relationships** (not physical joins), sometimes on single keys and sometimes on multiple fields.
